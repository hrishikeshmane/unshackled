      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the right "track" for me? How do I choose?',
    answer: (

        <p>Of course! Immigration is not a simple topic.</p>

          <strong>
            If you're looking for ways to self-sponsor your green card and
            current don't have a priority date, we recommend looking at the
            EB-1A and EB-2 NIW tracks.
          </strong>{" "}
          The difference between the two tracks is this: EB-1A is a{" "}
          <em>first</em>-preference employment based green card category whereas
          the EB-2 NIW is a <em>second</em>-preference one. As of Nov 2024, the
          priority date for EB-1 categories for Indian nationals is 15th April,
          2022. On the other hand, the priority date for EB-2 categories for
          Indian nationals is 1st January, 2013. (IMPORTANT: The visa bulletin
          changes <em>every</em> month.{" "}
          <a
            href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-bulletin.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Please check this link
          </a>{" "}
          for the latest one.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If you already have a priority date, originate from India/China, and
            want to get your green card faster, we recommend looking at the
            EB-1A track.
          </strong>{" "}
          We say this since the priority dates for EB-1A are currently the
          closest to present time. However, if you're not from India or China,
          we recommend you look at both the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            If you're looking to start a company or looking for an alternative
            to the H-1B, we recommend looking at the O-1A track.
          </strong>{" "}
          The O-1A is a temporary work visa (like the H-1B). It's a great option
          for founders, as well as those who want an alternative to the H-1B and
          have the right credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          We hope that helped. None of this is legal advice. In the end, we
          recommend you consult a lawyer on the pathway that best fits your
          needs.
